## Code Organization
- Every folder is a sub component/project of the whole system, see README in each folder for details

## Code contribution guideline
1. Never push to master, master is locked ðŸ˜€
2. If you want to make a change, make a commit on a branch
3. If your branch is stale (relative to master), [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) it
4. Once you are done with changes locally, publish your branch to github (here)
5. Make a pull request to merge your branch into the master branch
6. Request reviews from all remaining collaborators
7. Once you have one approval, merge the pull request yourself
8. If changes are needed, make changes locally and push them to github (same branch), the pull request will update automatically, just re-request review again.
